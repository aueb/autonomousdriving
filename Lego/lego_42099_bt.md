## App
* https://www.lego.com/en-gb/service/device-guide/control-plus

"NB: during the period of reviewing the set we discovered that the Powered Up elements that come in 42099 set are programmed in such a way that the application won’t let you connect to the model unless all the motors are plugged into the right ports. Even if one motor is missing the app will inform you that the model is out of reach. The current way of controlling the Powered Up elements via Control+ app doesn’t let you run your own models with a different set or number of motors connected to the hub."
